Hey Today I have learned about The Concept of Streams in Node js .
Basically streams are objects that let you read data from Source and write data to a destination in a continuous fashion .

Each type of stream is an event emitter that throws several events at different times,
like data , end , error and finish events.

There is one more technique to do this is
const rstream = fs.createReadStream("read.txt");
 rstream.pipe(res) method.
